# space-shootem
Final project for Mobile Apps course

This game is essentially a knockoff of old arcade games like Galaga and Space Invaders.

# Future Ideas
change speeds

different weapons

enemies shoot back

joystick options instead of tilt controls

# Miscellaneous Things to Change
Various bugs in UI

Not sure why the bulletsizedp is static, that should be changed to be more consistent with getters

Maybe limit framerate, unsure if this will *really* matter. Worth checking

# TODOs
Documentation

Fix slowdowns when enemies spawn, likely due to something with painting the canvas
*NOTE: This issue will be solved when the enemies have "formations" instead of just randomly spawning

Adding bosses will require changing the checks during each frame
